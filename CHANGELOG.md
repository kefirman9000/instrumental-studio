# What's new

## 1.1.0

- The separation model now installs itself. The first time you start the app it downloads and sets it up in the background, choosing the right version for your graphics card (NVIDIA or Apple silicon) automatically. No more terminal commands.
- If the install fails, the start screen says why and offers **Try again**. Settings has **Reinstall separation model**.
- **Check for updates** is now on the start screen too.
- Splitting no longer depends on parts of PyTorch that changed in recent versions, so it works with current Python and PyTorch releases.

## 1.0.1

- After an update, the Mac and Linux start files can still be double-clicked.

## 1.0.0

The first version of Instrumental Studio.

- Turn any song into an instrumental: it's split into drums, bass, other instruments and vocals (or bring stems you already have).
- See exactly where removing the vocals damaged each instrument.
- Damaged spots are rebuilt from the same instrument playing the same part elsewhere in the song.
- Listen before and after, loop A/B, hear only what was added, or hear where it was borrowed from.
- Accept or reject each fix, change how strong it is, or choose a different place to borrow from.
- See how fixable every instrument is in every section of the song.
- Adjust the volume of each instrument, or of one instrument in one section.
- Find and remove vocal that leaked into the instruments.
- Undo, saved projects, and export to WAV, FLAC or MP3.
- Check for updates from inside the app, with optional automatic installs.
